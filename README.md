## Welcome to my Portfolio!

My name is Brandon Stoia and I'm a rising junior at Miami University with an expected graduation in May 2024. I'm an honors & university scholars student with a Bachelor of Arts in Data Analytics and a Bachelor of Science in Data Science & Statistics with a minor in Business Analytics. 

## Ohio COVID Surges and Unemployment
- This project included reading data from the Ohio COVID Dashboard and also accessing unemployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics API.
- Using ggplot in R, I created this dashboard of COVID and Unemployment facts.
